# JS-SampleCodeStudentRecords

This is a mini sample code I woked on when getting into JS. This code is the display the functionality of JS that I know.

This program is to display some Javasript I have. The input that can be entered are "Dave", "Jody", "Jordan", "John", and "Trish".
This program will be updated
